- add comments goddamn bro
- Harden node type setting (checking if node is file or directory)
- At the moment, there's no handling of duplicate nodes, meaning that if two nodes both load the same path as a derived node, two separate nodes will be created. Tbh, I'm not sure if that's really a problem. I imagine that if a path is used in multiple places it should be put in an assets directory and loaded with the `asset` page mode. I should add a path prefix or some other way for a path to be marked as non-dependable. Individual source processors can ofc handle it on their own, but having a standard would be good.
- Context inheritance should be better. Merging object like `assetProcessors` and `extraContext`.
- What if there's no source file? Do I skip? Provide source processors with an empty buffer? Error?
- Option to ignore directories
- Pretty error logs
- Hide accidental exports (context schema) (hell maybe I should ditch the whole schema thing completely and go pure TS. I can generate schemas at build time if I really need)
- Export version info (for downstream client consumption so they don't have to do garbage with `package.json` finding)
- rename `loadContextTreeNode` to fit it's phase name
- Add `TartanConfig` to the core library
- Have distinct type for after output, where `outputPath` is the actual fs path (relative to the output directory) (so like a page would be `{output path}/index.html`)
- Maybe add output file/block size after nodes are finalized?
